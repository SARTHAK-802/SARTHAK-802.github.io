<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Greetings! I am Sarthak Maity, I got my M.Sc. (2025) in Chemistry (specialization: computaional chemistry) at <a href="https://www.iiti.ac.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Indore (IIT Indore)</a>, India, advised by <a href="https://people.iiti.ac.in/~biswarup/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Biswarup Pathak</a>. Prior to joining IIT Indore, I received my B.Sc. in Chemistry from <a href="https://midnaporecollege.ac.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Midnapore College (Autonomous)</a> in 2020, West Bengal, India.</p> <p>My research focuses on DFT-based modeling of catalytic materials and the application of machine learning, including graph neural networks, to materials discovery. I have experience in density functional theory, atomistic simulations, and materials modeling. In parallel, I have developed practical experience in machine learning and deep learning, with a foundational understanding of ML interatomic potentials for DFT-accurate, large-scale atomistic simulations in chemistry and materials science.</p> <p>At a glance, my graduate-level research involved integrating density functional theory with machine-learning approaches to model and design Pt sub-nanocluster electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), enabling efficient exploration of fluxional cluster geometries and the development of fluxionality-aware structure–stability–activity descriptors.</p> </body></html>
